# Paired-Junction-Transformation
A Python tool for mapping water quality distribution in Southern Ontario's rivers and watersheds using paired junction ordering. It provides insightful water quality assessments by categorizing river segments into subcatchments, highlighting the impact of local land use


Paired Junction Transformation for Water Quality Mapping in Southern Ontario

This repository contains the Python implementation of the Paired Junction Transformation method, a product of research conducted by Shuyang Wang and Dr. Chris Smart at Unversity of Western Ontario. This novel approach to water quality assessment in river systems focuses on mapping chloride distribution across southern Ontario. The method utilizes paired junction ordering, which assigns unique numerical values to each segment within a drainage network, thereby revealing spatial coherence among these segments. This technique enables the categorization of streams into subcatchments based on their paired junction orders, facilitating a detailed visual assessment of river chloride levels.

The "network space," defined by the paired-junction order-root area, serves as the foundation for this method. It offers an organized representation of a stream network, emphasizing headwater streams where local land use significantly impacts water quality. This Python codebase is designed to assist researchers, environmentalists, and policy-makers in understanding and visualizing the intricate relationships between land use, stream network structure, and water quality in riverine ecosystems.

Key Features:

- Implementation of paired junction ordering for a unique and spatially coherent numerical representation of drainage network segments.
- Visual mapping of chloride distribution in river systems, with a special focus on the intricate network of southern Ontario.
- Analysis of the impact of local land use on water quality in headwater streams through the lens of network space.

This tool is a useful resource for conducting environmental assessments and formulating strategies for the preservation and improvement of water quality in river ecosystems.
