# Paired-Junction-Transformation
A Python tool for mapping chloride distribution in Southern Ontario's rivers using paired junction ordering. It provides insightful water quality assessments by categorizing river segments into subcatchments, highlighting the impact of local land use


Paired Junction Transformation for Water Quality Mapping in Southern Ontario

This repository contains the Python implementation of the Paired Junction Transformation method, a novel approach to water quality assessment in river systems, with a focus on mapping chloride distribution across southern Ontario. The core of this method lies in the concept of paired junction ordering, a technique that assigns a unique numerical value to each segment within a drainage network, revealing spatial coherence among these segments. This approach enables the categorization of streams into subcatchments based on their paired junction orders, facilitating a detailed visual assessment of river chloride levels.

The "network space," defined by the paired-junction order-root area, serves as the foundation for this method. It offers an organized representation of a stream network, emphasizing headwater streams where local land use significantly impacts water quality. This Python codebase is designed to assist researchers, environmentalists, and policy-makers in understanding and visualizing the intricate relationships between land use, stream network structure, and water quality in riverine ecosystems.

Key Features:

Implementation of paired junction ordering to achieve a unique and spatially coherent numerical representation of drainage network segments.
